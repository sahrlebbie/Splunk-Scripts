# Splunk-Scripts
OpenPath Splunk Scripts

Welcome to OpenPath LLC. We have created some scripts that we hope could be useful for you when doing testing of Splunk in PROD, DEV, STAGE, or UAT.

As any wise engineer would do, please validate these scripts first by testing in your environment before deploying into your production environment. Some of these scripts require some basic dependencies but they are often baseline utilities/commands often deployed with most systems, in most part linux(specifically CENTOS/RHEL 6/7/8).

Please let us know if there is anything we can do to make these scripts better.

Respectfully,

Sahr Lebbie
